# Sandbox


Being a part of the Research and Development team at Sandbox, I was Team Lead for the video analysis group. Over the semester, we created a program that used Google's Youtube Data API to parse through comments for any given video and extracted the timestamps from the comments. This was then identified as traction at different points of the video and used to locate the portions that were best received from which, gifs were automatically made using moviepy. This was then coupled with audio data to find a correlation between different aspects of the video and what Youtubers could improve upon for more traction.

Alongside this, we looked at the implementation of a machine learning algorithm for Youtube thumbnails that would identify the key areas to generate more impressions.
